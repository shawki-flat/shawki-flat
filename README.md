# Shawki Flat ðŸ’«

Shawki Flat is the light package that will make the design of your web applications spreads faster. We authorize you to write CSS code and build UI designs without any restriction from our side, no HTML classes, no additional CSS or JavaScript code!

_**Documentation:**_ We are working on a documentation website for our package which will include all its properties, utilities, and UI components. So up to this point, we are just providing our package without a real documentation.

## Navigation

We still don't have that fancy website that includes documentation and other fancy pages, but up to this point we have a tiny [Getting Started](docs/getting-started.md) page, and a useful [Shawki Flat API](docs/api.md) page that for sure, can lead you to manage our package, so feel free to discover them!

## Shawki Flat Purpose?

I started building this package out of my great love and curiosity for web design and development in the first place, and CSS and Sass in the second place. On November 16, I started searching for tutorials on the internet and planning the package journey. Four days later, I started spending all my time experimenting with the package, and here I am uploading it for you to help me scale it. Thanks!
